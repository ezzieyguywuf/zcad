Another attempt at my own Computer Aided Design (CAD) package.

# status

very much WIP. Currently I can render a few things (see demo).

# previous work

Previous attempts include [mycad](https://github.com/mycad-org/mycad-base)
(written in c++), [rcad](https://github.com/ezzieyguywuf/rcad) (written in
rust), and [mycad](https://github.com/ezzieyguywuf/mycad) written in haskell.

Actually the order was:

1. mycad in haskell
2. mycad in c++
3. rcad in rust

Those repositories/readmes probably include some interesting context/history.
